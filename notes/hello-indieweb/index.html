        <p class="e-content"><p>Heya. It's been a while since I've made something exciting for myself. Consider this website my playground. I've never agreed with the state of the internet. And this is my attempt to make a difference, for myself. That's why this website is slowly moving in to be an Indieweb enabled 'microblog'. Hopefully, in the future, I'll be able to syndicate my notes from here. For now, Webmention seems to work.s</p>
